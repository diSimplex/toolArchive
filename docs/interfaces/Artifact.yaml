# A YAML description of the artifact RESTful interface

description: |
  Responsible for both listing the current cached status of an artifact as 
  well as downloading a given artifact.

comment: |
  RESTful HTTP interfaces dictate the use of DELETE and PUT to denote 
  change. Unfortunately current browsers do not allow users to directly use 
  the DELETE or PUT verbs in forms. While we could provide a JavaScript 
  interface built using, for example, MithrilJS, one goal has been to keep 
  the default HTML interface both complete and simple HTML. 

interface:

    method: GET
    credentials: CommonName of the Client X509 certificate
