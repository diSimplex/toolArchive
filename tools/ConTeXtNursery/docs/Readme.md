# ConTeXt Nursery documents

This directory collects the constantly evolving collection of architectural 
and implementation documentation for the ConTeXt Nursery project.

While the definitive documentation for any open source project will 
inevitably be in the code itself, these documents are meant to capture an 
overview of roughly why the code is "shaped" the way it is.

The current overview of the architecture can be found in the 
[Architecture](docs/Architecture.md) document.

A ragtag list of various resources considered while developing this project 
can be found in the [Resources](docs/Resources.md) document.
