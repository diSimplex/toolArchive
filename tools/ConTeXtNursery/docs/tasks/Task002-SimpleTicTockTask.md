# Task 002

1. **Probably completed** Add the ability to run a simple Tic/Tock shell 
   script which runs for a variable length of time. 

2. **Probably completed** Add the ability to view the output/logfile in 
   "real time" using the Primary Nursery's webserver. 

## Reflections

None -- stoped in favour of other work and when restared we switched to 
using NATS as a messaging back-plane and hence solve both messaging and 
federation.
